***This file changes are not required*****

swagger.json is not fully correct
so following steps were performed (you can refer to commit f92582f):

1. Format swagger.json file
2. Find operation /api/v2/equipment-models/{equipmentCode}
3. Change line

"$ref": "#/definitions/equipmentModelDocument"

to

"$ref": "#/definitions/equipmentModel"



4. Find "channelReferenceCollection": {
5. Replace it totally with


"channelReferenceCollection": {
    "uniqueItems": false,
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "$ref": "#/definitions/channelReference"
    }
},



6. Generate client class with EquipmentApiClientGenerate.bat
